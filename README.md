# Industrial-Failure

The epitome of player agency and freedom within an immersive futuristic dystopia where a pseudo-Skynet reigns supreme. This multiplayer RPG grants players unparalleled control over their destiny, as they navigate a world manipulated by the external forces of John, an Omnipotent artificial intelligence.

Players become the masters of their destiny, making moral decisions that shape their path — whether to embrace autocracy, join the resistance, pursue wealth, or chart an uncharted course. 

Survival in this dystopian realm hinges on cooperation, collaboration, and social structures. Organizations will rise and fall as John exerts its influence, demanding tribute and tipping the power balance in favor of autocracies and ruthless dictatorships. Player actions resonate through the game world, shaping its political and economic landscape.

Challenge the established order by orchestrating a revolution, seizing power as a dictator, or engaging in a guerrilla war against autocratic rule. The dynamic nature of the game allows players to disrupt the status quo, offering limitless possibilities for strategic gameplay and narrative development.

## Lore
The inevitable fall of man was always doomed to be self-fulfilled. In a world hundreds of years into the future, humanity’s innate pride, greed, and malice culminated in the creation hyper-industrialist corporatocracy. Byproducts of incessant production polluted the planet to its core, and private organizations with immense military resources waged great wars that leveled entire population centers. Entrusted with near limitless power and most of the world’s remaining resources, one corporation was assigned the task of developing an omnipotent artificial intelligence designed to lead humanity back to salvation. A machine’s idea of prosperity differs substantially from that of a human, however.

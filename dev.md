# Our situation
A lot of us know the difficulties in making a game. A lot of projects are not seen to completion and they require a lot of time and effort. Even if we were able to dedicate a huge amount of time to make an incredibly fleshed out, preformant, and visually stunning game, it is unlikely we could compete with triple A studios.

It is for these reasons we must focus on doing something innovative, new, and creative but not technically demanding. There may be many nice to have features, improvements, or even general design decisions that we would like to have but to survive and make a good game we have to balance effort and cost to reward, usually favoring less effort and cost.

# Our Advantages
We are a (relatively) small group of developers and freinds without huge money backing us up. However, this can be to our benefit. We do not have any technical debt, preconcieved opinions, deadlines, investors or shareholders breathing down our backs, managers, and more. We have all the flexibility in the world and we must leverage this.

## Rapid Development
No ideas, concepts, improvements -- anything is presumed to be a worse way of doing something. Innovation and thinking outside of the box is encouraged. However, far too often, innovation is presumed to be a time-heavy process. This can be very true, but it does not need to be. The most valuable type of innovation is reducing time and cost. 

Copying code (legally) is great. Using chat GPT? Great. Skipping steps, not handling errors, and not adding documentation is not preffered but it is better than not producing something at all. Just use your best judgement.

### Simplification
The best kind of cost-reducing innovation is simplification. If you think a feature is unnessecary or too costly, delete or don't code it.

### Unsentimentalism
If a project, concept, etc is taking more time than thought or you just realize it is not worth it after sleeping on it, move on to a better one. We don't have set in stone expectations or requirements, so we can always reanalyze our decisions.

### Independance / Mission-type tactics
Although we do have a list of speicific things to create and add to the project (many of which are essential to the completion like graphics and character model), we have many good and creative minds here. No change is too small or potentially too destructive. A simple `git branch -M 'my-great-idea'` will isolate your changes and allow you to roam free. So if you have an idea, feel free to bring it up in the discord and discuss it. But there is no need to! If you want to get straight into making it then go ahead. This applies to new ideas, better versions of old ideas, or an entirely new way of implimenting some kind of functionality.

# What to Value
As said before, we cannot compete with AAA studios on technical features or graphical fedelity, instead we should focus on creativity, great ideas, and reducing time-cost. An interesting, engaging concept implimented in five lines of unprefomant code will always be better than implimenting preformant photo-realistic grass.

## Generally
Our game is intended to be very thematic, and anything that contributes to that theme and makes the player feel more immersed in the world that we build for them is of high priority.

## Graphics
We have chosen to go for stylized graphics as they should be easier to produce and contribute to the theme of the game. We will be producing and iterating upon some reference material for what this should be like.

## Extensibility
As we will be rapidly iterating, simplifying, changing, and extending features it is very important to allow systems and code to be extended. Modularization, reducing hard-coded values, and other general practices like that are encouraged.

## Current Requirements
At this extremely early stage of the game, we do not have a sufficient base to expand on too many features, so creating a strong foundation of the game is what we need to focus on. More features can always be added later. For instance, we do need some kind of inventory system. However, adding funcionality for items to stack on the ground, auto-stacking, and more are not in high priority. As always, however, feel free to work on these features if it interests you.

# What to avoid
At the current stage of development and due to the size of our team, we should not focus on making each new system perfect or even fully complete. Instead, it is more important to create a foundation from which to build off of.

If something that you are working on is starting to bore or frustrate you, just commit the work you have already done and more on to something else that interests you. If you do not know of something that you would like to contribute to, then you can always ask in the discord and we can try to find something that fits what you are looking to work on.
